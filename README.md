# Enhancing the Tourist Experience in Cyprus (EnterCY)


The EnterCY project is based on an integrated virtual and augmented reality platform utilizing cutting-edge Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for promoting Cyprus as an attractive destination by:

- Informing and educating potential visitors about the rich cultural heritage, variety of activities and wealth of sightseeing locations of Cyprus through a spatio-temporal virtual (VR) exploration before their visit.
- Enhancing tourists experience and satisfaction by providing visual and audio guidance, navigation, as well as entertaining and learning by storytelling through augmented reality (AR) with location-awareness during their visit in both indoor and outdoor sites.
- Offering an after-visit experience through immersive reality (IR) technologies, by providing tourists with a personal 360° video of their on-site tour after their visit as a memento.
- Allowing tourists to share their experience in real-time through the platform integration with social media.

In all stages of the EnterCY platform, personalization will be employed for presenting the tourists with information and suggestions tailored to their personal interests and needs.

### Preface
The user-friendly web-based Content Management System (CMS) allows both the technical and non-technical users to store and manage their data. 
The design and implementation of the CMS provide an interface for managing the data of the following components:
- Attractions, Activities and Tourist-services
- 3D-Data
- Personalization component
- Indoor Positioning Service (IPS)
- Storytelling

The platform’s back-end is implemented using the Laravel PHP web framework and follows the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, using MariaDB as a database server (which is based on the open-source MySQL code). The Laravel-based application provides the platform’s authentication service.
